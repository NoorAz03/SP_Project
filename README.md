This project focuses on classifying music into distinct genres using audio signal processing and machine learning techniques. Utilising a Support Vector Machine (SVM), the project analyses audio tracks from the GTZAN dataset, categorised into genres such as blues, classical, and rock. The project encompasses data pre-processing, feature extraction using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), model training, and evaluation to develop effective strategies for automated music genre classification.

The dataset used is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification/data and is referenced throughout the paper.

This work is submitted as part of the Signal Processing course at HFU, under the supervision of Professor Leonardo Noriega.
